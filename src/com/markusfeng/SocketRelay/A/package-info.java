/**
 * The com.markusfeng.SocketRelay API A package contains
 * classes to create a basic SocketClient and SocketServer that utilize
 * SocketHandlers. This package is sufficient, though it is recommended
 * to be used with the B package, as it provides concrete implementations to
 * SocketHandler. Note that this package also depends on the L package,
 * as the SocketServer implements SocketListenerHandler to enable
 * handling of SocketListeners.
